    <p>I am an active programmer, software engineer & the mad Dad as a workaholic of two cute little sons. When I am
        not playing with them, I often discover crazy ideas and strive to carry out them.</p>

            <h4>Université de Bordeaux<br/>
                <span class="title-qual">Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Doctorate
                    (2010 – 2015)</span>
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Metabolic network is a linked series of biochemical reactions that begins with a particular molecule
                    and converts it into some other molecule or molecules in a carefully defined fashion in living
                    organisms. Studying these networks is one of current challenges in the field of biology, computer
                    science, statistics and related other disciplines. We are working with a technique in graph theory
                    to inhibit the production of a certain objective product in the network. The obtained results are
                    really huge.
                </li>
                <li>Classification of these results can be considered as a way to gain in-depth insight into a few of
                    specific functions. For instance, how do we find the solutions to obstruct the production of starch
                    in plant cell metabolism.
                </li>
                <li>Finding new methods to model, analyze and predict biological functions in Metabolic Networks.</li>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p>We did try to combine Elementary Flux Modes and Minimal Cut Sets.
                To compute EFMs and MCSs, we can either use CellNetAnalyzer or combine regEfmTools and mcsCalculator</p>
